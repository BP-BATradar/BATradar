# BATradar: Acoustic Drone Localization Engine

This repository contains the implementation of a Bachelor's project focused on detecting drones using audio signals. The project explores methods for identifying drone presence from recorded sound, trains detection models, and provides scripts and datasets for reproducing the experiments.

## Overview

BATradar was implemented as part of a Bachelor's thesis. The primary goal is to detect and classify drone audio captured in outdoor recordings. The codebase includes data organization, preprocessing tools, simple training and evaluation scripts, and example recordings used during development.
